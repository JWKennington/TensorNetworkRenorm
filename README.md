# Bard Summer School on Quantum Gravity
These files and notebooks were produced at the Bard Summer School on Quantum
Gravity at Bard College during the summer of 2019. The notebooks
are the product of a computing lab focused on tensor network renormalization.

I have included a python and julia version of each notebook to act as a 
guide for those new to julia (who might be more familiar with python).
